            <p>The <b><u>theme system</u></b> is an easy way for you to make progress towards a certain theme that you can keep in mind during your day-to-day decision making. The theme system encourages self-reflection and helps gradually modify human behavior rather than brutely trying to force change on certain aspects of your life. 
                <br><br>
